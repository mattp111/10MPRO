# helloWorld

["Hello, World!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) is the first program of almost every programmer. It is one of the most basic programs you can write, and simply displays the text "Hello, World!" to a screen (or other output).

Your goal is to write the HTML necessary to display "Hello, World!" to the user in a web page.

## Steps

1. We will often use online resources to help us learn. To get started learning HTML, we are going to use [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/).

    - Begin the Codecademy tutorial above, and continue reading until you feel comfortable creating a basic HTML page with the text "Hello, World!"
    - Use W3Schools to augment your learning and answer questions you might have in the Codecademy course.

2. When you're ready, start by opening Brackets, making a new file (Ctrl-N), and saving it (Ctrl-S) as `helloWorld.html`.

    - Brackets will automatically colour and style your code, but only **after** you have saved the file with an appropriate extension (`.html`).

3. Fill out the basic HTML structure that you learned from the Codecademy tutorials.

    - Remember, every HTML page must start with `<!DOCTYPE html>` and have an `<html>` section with the a `<head>` and `<body>`.
    - Also remember that each HTML element (like `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`) needs a matching close tag when it ends! (`</html>`, etc)

4. Once you have the HTML structure filled out, put an `<h1>` element in the body with the message, "Hello, world!"

Congratulations, you're done your first HTML program!
